    "Advantages of Boosting Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved Accuracy: Boosting significantly enhances the accuracy of models by combining multiple weak learners, each of which corrects the errors of its predecessors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Robustness to Overfitting: Boosting methods, particularly those with regularization (like Gradient Boosting with shrinkage), are less prone to overfitting compared to other techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexibility: Boosting can be applied to a wide range of machine learning problems, including classification, regression, and ranking tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Handles Complex Relationships: By focusing on difficult-to-predict instances, boosting can capture complex patterns and interactions in the data that single models might miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of Boosting Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Computationally Intensive: Training models sequentially makes boosting computationally expensive and slower compared to parallelizable methods like bagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sensitive to Noisy Data: Boosting can overfit to noisy data since it places greater emphasis on hard-to-predict examples, which may include outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parameter Tuning: Boosting algorithms often require careful tuning of multiple hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of estimators) to achieve optimal performance, which can be time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Complexity: The sequential training and combination of multiple models can make the final boosted model complex and harder to interpret compared to single models or simpler ensemble methods.\n",
